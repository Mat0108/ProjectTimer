## Installation

Project Timer requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v10+ to run.

Install and launch docker to start the server for both API and the web application.

```sh
cd ProjectTimer/
docker-compose up --build
```

To see the web application, you need to wait for the docker to finish running. It might take a while for the docker to finish. You will see the log below when docker has finished running :
